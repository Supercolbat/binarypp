# Contributing
Thanks for showing interest in Binary++! All contributions are welcome as long as they follow the Binary++ vision!

# Binary++ Vision
Binary++ aims to be a minimalistic but complex language. Features should only be added if they don't already have a current alternative or they would be very beneficial to add.

Currently, there is no clear outline for what will or will not get accepted.

# Coding style
Binary++ follows the [Black](https://github.com/psf/black) coding style and the [PEP 8 naming conventions](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#naming-conventions).
